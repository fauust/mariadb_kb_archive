Another option is to tag the SELECT statements with &lt;a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise/mariadb-maxscale/maxscale-hint-syntax/"&gt;routing hints&lt;/a&gt; that send them to the master server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the slavelagfilter, which routes SELECTS after data modification to the master. It isn't currently included in the package but you can build it yourself by adding &lt;code&gt; -DBUILD_SLAVELAG=Y &lt;/code&gt; when configuring the build.&lt;/p&gt;
