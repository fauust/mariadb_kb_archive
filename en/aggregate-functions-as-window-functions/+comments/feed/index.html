(re: version 10.2.0 alpha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partition by is not a requirement in other databases. It is often very useful to have an over clause that is blank () so as to count or sum across the whole result set. This avoids having to join into an inline view that computes the same thing. It's the only way to calculate what ratio_to_report would in Oracle (without added subqueries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this does not seem to run at all:
select x.*, count(x) over() as tot_rows
from(
select 1 as x
union all 
select 2
) x&lt;/p&gt;
