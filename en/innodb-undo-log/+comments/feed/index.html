For example, can you delete an undo log after a system is safely shut down?  Do these undo logs shrink?  Explaining the additional settings in context.  Can you move an undo log to a new directory when the server is shut down for example.  These are mostly operations questions, but the architecture questions should be answered as well.&lt;/p&gt;
