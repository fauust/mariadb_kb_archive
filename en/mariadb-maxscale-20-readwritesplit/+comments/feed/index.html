&lt;p&gt;The main idea why readwritesplit closes the session when the master changes is to prevent "silent" master failover or replication topology changes. Sometimes this isn't what is wanted and being able to change masters transparently to the application is very valuable. Adding support for transparent master failover would be quite nice as it would integrate MaxScale better with software such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/tanji/replication-manager"&gt;replication-manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In trying to test this out with worst case scenarios I've been forcibly killing the master at the same moment I'm updating drupal. 
Maxscale does it's job and switches the master node to another node and if I reload the page it works but I'd love it instead of failing maxscale made the client pause until it connected to the new master and retry instead. &lt;/p&gt;
